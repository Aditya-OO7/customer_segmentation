Product segmentation refers to the activity of grouping products that have similar characteristics and serve a similar market. It is usually related to marketing (Sales Categories) or manufacturing (Production Processes). However as a **Supply Chaine Engineer** your focus is not on the product itself but more on the complexity of managing its flow.

Your want to understand the sales volumes distribution (fast/slow movers) and demand variability to optimize your production, storage and delivery operations to ensure the best service level by considering: 
- The highest contribution to your total volume: ABC Analysis
- The most unstable demand: Demand Variability

I have designed this **Streamlit App** to provide a tool to **Supply Chain Engineers** for Product Segmentation, with a focus on retail products, of their portofolio considering the complexity of the demand and the volumes contribution of each item.
